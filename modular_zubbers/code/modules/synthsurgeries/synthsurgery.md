You can only take 1 plating surgery in main and auxiliary (50%) at a time.
Reactive Plating: 35% resistant to brute damage and 25% reduction in stun time if taken as main.
Ablative Plating: 35% resistance to burn damage and energy weapons deal less damage to synth if taken as main.
Insulated Plating: 70% resistance to heat damage and 105% extra resistance to cold damage, and become fireproof if taken as main.

Superconductor Hyperfeed: EMP resistance, shock immunity, and electricity feeding.
High-Force Hydraulics: Hit harder, dealing more damage (stacking with cargo arm implants).

Procedural Algorithm Optimization - Faster at all tasks vs Motor Algorithm Optimization - Faster movement speed

(Illicit) Choice between being able to force open doors with raw force or the ability to increase the power of grabs (making them harder to break free of)
