## Makeshift Lasers!
What do they do?

They're laser weapons.. Kinda. Not code-wise but we'll get there. They are craftable laser weapons with a lot of modularity* and malfunction* and upgrades*.

*These may not be included in the current build.

## Why It's Good For The Game
1 - Adds more makeshift and craftable weapons, acting as ghetto lasers with certain materials required from multiple departments to make them good as stock (with a lot of effort!)

2 - Adds more options for weaponry, diverse weaponry options is always good in a game. A lack of weapon diversity, especially in the meta, typically results in stale and repetitive combat where everyone, ideally, uses the same weapons. There is no intent for that here.

3 - Grants more roleplaying opportunity given the illegality of all three weapon types.
