Q - What do each set of them even do?
A - Good question.
1 - Bionics. Basically, what you can print at Robotics. There will be some more stuff, but a new class, Experimental Organs, is added. In addition to multiple new things. Bionics are generally stronger than their contemporaries at the cost of being weak to EMPs.

2 - Implants. These can be printed and added to implant cases to inject them into a person, generally act the same as implants in other ways. 

3 - Biology. Stuff that medical can prepare. Enhancements are created with special Organ Injectors. Organ Injectors must be filled with reagents. 

To combine injectors, simply use one on the other and they will combine into the related injector. Note that Strength injectors are not compatible, and only Enhanced Adaptation can combine with other Adaptation Injectors.

4 - Xenobiology. Xenobiology has two new categories of Crossbreeds, Mutative and Transformative. So what do Mutatives and Transformatives do?

Mutative Extracts, once charged with 10u of Liquid Plasma, can be used in two ways: 
1 - On organ items. It converts that organ into the related slime organ of the specific mutation it is color coded for.
2 - On people. It will open a menu that allows you to select what organ you wish to target. It will briefly cause a lot of pain and stamina damage, before finishing its conversion. 

Transformative Extracts, one charged with 100u of Liquid Plasma, can be used in the following three ways:
1 - On organ items. It transforms that organ into a related slime organ of the mutation it is color coded for.
2 - On people, opens a menu that allows you to select what organ you wish to target. It will briefly case a lot of pain and stamina damage, before transforming that organ.
3 - Activate it in your hand. This will change its mode to Throwing. Throw it at a target to inflict the person version. It will afflict a random organ in the area affected.

How to make them? It's very simple! Just use 10 Green Extract on any adult slime to turn them into a Mutative Colored Extract. And use 10 Black Extract on any adult slime to turn them into a Transformative Colored Extract.

Further Elaboration in Xenobiology.

5 - Nanite. The Nanite Organs are special in that they are, on their own, stronger than virtually any other organ, including Xenobiology! However, they have some caveats.
- You have weakness to EMPs. However, rather than stunning you, they damage your entire body.
- The organ, while it does heal faster, takes more damage.
- If you have more than one nanite organ, you are afflicted with Nanite Corruption. The effects of which are below:
Level 1 - +5% brute/burn damage taken
Level 2 - +10% brute/burn damage taken
Level 3 - +30% brute/burn damage taken
Level 4 - +60% brute/burn damage taken
Level 5 - +100% brute/burn damage taken. On death, you are instantly husked.
Level 6 - +9999% brute/burn damage taken. Any attack will instantly kill you and turn you into a bloody puddle.
Level 7 - Instantly kills you and turns you into a bloody puddle.
- Using nanite powers increases your nanite corruption by 1 as well.
