## What are those!!!

Good question.

Subdermal plates are specialized plating designed to be inserted, well, underneath the dermal layer. Skin deep, as they'd say.

Subdermal plates come in three different specializations:
Subdermal layer: Offers light protection whilst being flexible and cheap, albeit its flexibility prevents it from offering limb health bonuses or nullification protection. 
Subdermal armor: Offers moderate protection, including insulation, and increased limb health, causing only minor impairment.
Subdermal carapace: Offers heavy protection, including insulation, and increased both limb and body health, causing greater impairment however.

And, they come in four tiers:
Made: Standard made subdermal plates. Lowest bonuses but also lowest maluses. Commonplace enough that security starts with multiple autosurgeons able to implant their choice of subdermal plates.
Upgraded: Upgraded subdermal plates, with stronger materials. Moderate bonuses and maluses. A good set of these will generally improve survivability greatly.
Advanced: Advanced subdermal plates, with strongest mass produced materials, and powered. Strongest bonuses and maluses, with emp weakness. Very effective.
Syndicate: Subdermal plates innovated by Interdyne. Strongest materials, strongest possible bonuses and maluses. A full set of autoinjectors can be bought for 20 TC.
