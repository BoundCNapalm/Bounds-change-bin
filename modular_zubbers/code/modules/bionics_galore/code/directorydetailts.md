## Folders

Q - What are any of these?

A - Good question. Bionics Galore is separated into six main folders, which are then separated based either on individual upgrades if they are upgradeable, or categories if they are not. The exception is the final folder which makes all of the other stuff work good.

1 - Bionics. These are organs and stuff that generally can be implanted via organ manipulation surgery. A fair few of these have active powers you can activate.

2 - Implants. These are stuff that is applied with the implanter. All implants are referred to as implants, but not all things called implants are implants. Confusing? Yes. However, we aren't exactly here for stuff that's completely and perfectly clear.

3 - Biology. This is the stuff for the Adapted Organs/Enhanced Organs. The means of crafting them are here too.

4 - Xenobiology. This is the stuff for the code of the Mutative Slime Organs and the related crossbreed cores. 

5 - Nanite. This is the stuff for the Nanite Organs. Also includes all of the power stuff.
