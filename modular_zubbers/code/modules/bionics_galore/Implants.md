## Bionics GALORE!!!!

What does this even do?!?!!!!!!!?!!?!?!!?!?!

It adds a shitton of bionics I made and came up with myself. It's not really groundbreaking technology what I'm adding, it's ideas you probably already seen before. To address some questions though.

Q - HOW many bionics?!
A - Atleast 80. Yes I said 80. This should adequately terrify lazy roboticists and medical doctors into fearing the power I hold over this codebase.

Q - Have you considered the combo of XYZ being utterly busted?
A - Cool! I love innovation in games. It's a shame that you need to ask for help to get your ideal meta combo. :)))

## Why is this good for the game?

1 - More diversity in bionics. Much like weapons, the more upgrades you can add to a game, the better it gets. More diversity and capabilities can create unique experiences.

2 - More stuff for medical and robotics to do. Medical often sits around doing nothing, no one cares about robotics until the borgs start acting fucky, someone wants an exosuit (HAH!), modsuit, or bionics very rarely.

3 - More roleplay opportunities. This grants more people reasons to interact with medical and robotics beyond the typical cycle of healing. Schedule doctor/robotics appointments for checkups and such.

4 - Xenobiology grows more terrifying by the day.

5 - Adds 3 extra paths to ascension; Rather than only cybernetics, you also have strong organs, and nanite organs, and xenobiological.

6 - Abductors are now not the only ones able to commit crimes against nature.
